# Base level investing

## First Things First.

You should build an emergency savings fund before you even think about investing, deal with any high intrerest debts, fix your credit and your mindset all before investing.

Your emergency fund should be equal to or more than *three to six* months worth of living expenses. Keep that in a Internet Bank Account at first then if you can find a Money Market account 
with better interest rates than your internet bank switch to the **MMA**

## Starting to Invest

Start investing in **stock** and **bond** mutual funds or ETFs(exchange traded fund). Remember that Index funds are historally a net positive when it comes to long term stock bets and provides generally lower fees than activley traded funds.

**Beware of Traders promising huge gains at low risk with high fees**

Fees are an Important to keep track of because of your rate of return.

Some advisors may advertise a high profit at the cost of loaded, commissioned funds

Heafty fees do no equate to successs! **low expenses are key**

### Mutual funds vs ETF's

Consider **2** Things:
1. Who are you as a person, are you a risk taker or do you prefer more long gradual funds. Mutual funds are safer but the minimum initial investment is High (i.e $3000)
2. Exchange traded funds (ETFs) are a riskier option because of the volitile nature of the ETF stock, but it has a lower initial investment and more potential for fast gains.
