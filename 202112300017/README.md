# Chapter 4 - Social Proof

We use what **other** people think to determine what is correct.

**I.E** In a eighth grade dance no one stars to dance until the first person breaks a move and doesnt get laughed at (We tend to see an action as appropriate when someone else is doing it)


Cialdini discusses the work of American psychologist [Albert Bandura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Bandura) (b.1925)

The results of both experiments showed that the children who had initially had dog phobias were no longer afraid of them after watching another kid play with the dogs.


This effect is amplified, when we are unsure of ourselves, when the situation is unclear or ambiguous, when uncertainty reigns, we are most likely to look to and accept the actions of others as correct.(**pluralistic ignorance**)

***Pluralistic ignorance*** - occurs when people see that those around them are not reacting and assume that there is nothing to which to react.

**I.E** If you want someone to call 911 in a dire situation your success rate for a actual call goes up exponentionally if you single someone out.

*People need to do two things to avoid falling victim to those who try to exploit social proof.* 

First, they need to be alert for fake social proof such as "real life" advertisements that are clearly rehearsed. 

Second, people need to simply stop and look around to determine whether the decision and its consequences are worth it.
