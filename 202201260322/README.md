# Atomic Habits- 1st And 2nd LAW


## 1st Law – Make it Obvious

- *Cues* that trigger our habits are many times invisible to us because habits a ingrained into our identity. (habits are formed so the brain does less work hence less conscious thought)
- Our responses to these cues are so hardwired that we must begin the process of behavior change with **awareness**, You need to identify youre habits to change them.
-  **Pointing-and-Calling** is One example James used to make his point that making one say a repeated behavior out loud brings **more awareness** to a habit.
-  He Uses two more examples *Implementation Intention* and *Habit Stacking Formula*

#### Implementation Intention

“I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].”

Specifically describing the exact action you will take at a specific cue will greatly increase your chance of success.

#### Habit Stacking Formula

 “After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].”

The application of this is quite broad, but to be most effective, the cue should be highly specific and immediately actionable.

- There is also importance of your environment. Dont think of things in your enviornment or living space as just things because you have a relationship with all of them.
- For example before reading this book i never used my couch for anything now i use my couch for reading so my brain attributes couch to reading. 
- It was easy to do with the couch because there were no pre existing habits that i had formed there.

**EITHER MAKE IT OBVIOUS OR MAKE IT INVISIBLE!**

## 2nd Law - Make it Attractive 

- **DOPAFUCKINGMINE**
- It isnt just released when you experience pleasure but also when you anticipate pleasure. Explains why sometimes the lead up to an event in your life isnt as stimulating as the actual event,
- **This anticipation is what gets us to take action.**
- You’re more likely to find a behavior attractive if you get to do one of your favorite things at the same time.

#### Temptation Bundling Equation

1. After [CURRENT HABIT], I Will [HABIT I NEED].

2. After [HABIT I NEED], I will [HABIT I WANT].

Let’s say you want to cut down on your Instagram use.

1. After I pull out my phone, I will do ten burpees (need).

2. After I do ten burpees, I will check Instagram (want).

- **We don’t choose our earliest habits – we imitate them.** Both of my parents were hard workers and I imitate that through my work but certain habits I have impede my growth to achieve greater success.
- We tend to imitate the habits of three groups of people:

1. The close

2. The many

3. The powerful

- One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior.
- Dont conform to the group
- imitate the powerful

Swap the word “have” with “get”. **MINDSET DETERMINES PLEASURE**
