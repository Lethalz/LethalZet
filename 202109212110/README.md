# Weapons of Influence

[Robert Cialdini](https://www.influenceatwork.com/about-dr-cialdini/) shows us the real reasons compliance professionals are successful in manipulating potential customers.

Cialdini says that most individuals can use persuasive tools as weapons of influence to get people to say yes. 

He tells a story about a store clerk who by accident, sold some jewelry for twice its initial value. "Expensive=good"

Our brain takes short cuts to make better decisions based on past expierences. 9/10 This approach will work but not this time.

Automatic actions assist in reducing "brain strain" but also make people vulnerable to the influence of others. 

The principles behind automatic action are so ingrained in our mind that they are simply accepted.

## The contrast Principle 

The contrast principle is another weapon of influence. 

Cialdini explains that under the contrast principle a buyer perceives the cost of an item based on the cost of another item. 

For example, after spending a lot of money on a suit, a consumer may be more willing to buy an expensive sweater than they would have been before purchasing the suit. 

They are more willing to buy the sweater because under the contrast principle the cost of the sweater, although expensive, feels cheap in comparison to the suit they have already purchased.
