# Encapsulation for packets of information over the network


To my understanding it seems as if at every level of the OSI/TCP:IP model there is a protocol with a job, it takes the information it needs from that packet and isn't concerned about the other data further inside the data

***For Example:***

A switch operates at the data link layer (layer 2) it uses MAC addresses to move information around (MAC addresses are provided by the computers NIC) once it take the information it needs it send it up the model to the Network layer and it's finished its duty.
