# CPP Input/Output

The `cout` statement tells cpp to show an output stream, which is some characters to be shown on the screen.

`cout << " You a Hoe!" << '\n'`

The **insertion operator** `<<` inserts the characters you input into the stream you call by the `cout` statement and prints to screen.
*cout = "ostream"**

----

The `cin` statement transfers data from the keyboard and puts it into the computer to fill a variable.

`cin >> PokemonName`

The **extraction operator** `>>` takes an item from the input stream and input it into the allocated memory for `PokemonName`

*cin = "istream"*

----

Hence why we have to put:

```
#include <iostream>

```

in the header.
