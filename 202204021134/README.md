### Strategies 

1. Breathe Right. …making yrouself breathe right calms you down and makes you feel better by powering up your rational brain. (103)
2. Create an Emotion vs. Reason List. Now, ask yourself two important questions: Where are your emotions clouding your judgment, and where is your reason ignoring important cues from your emotions? (104)
