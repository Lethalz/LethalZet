# Atomic Habits  - Part 1 The Fundamentals #

### 1. Habits are compound interest of self improvement ###
  - This is where the name of the book comes from small (Atomic) changes in your everyday life leads to **MASSIVE** Results.
  - We as Humans attribute massive success to massive action which is not how it works at all if you think about it
   
   *ie. You would like to start going to the gym so you start going everyday for 3 hours. Yes, thats a start but how long will you sustain that habit.*
  - 1% a day for a year is better than 100% for a month not only because you are now a greek god but because youve made it a **HABIT**. *PREACHHH..*
   > Success is the product of daily habits- not once-in-a-lifetime transformations - James Clear
   
   - Works Negetivly also The more you tell yourself that you’re not good enough, or stupid, or worthless, the more you’ll interpret life through that lens and ingrain it further and further.
   
### 2. Progress is Not Overnight ###

- "Rome wasn't built in a day" 
- Habits often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold and unlock a new level of performance.
- Youre habitual rewards will plateu but grit and perserverence will let you achieve massive reward

### 3. You Fall to the Level of Your Systems ###
 - “you don’t rise to the level of your goals, you fall to the level of your systems.” 
 - If youre having habit problems I feel bad for you son you got 90 bad habits cuz your system is dumb
 - Winners and losers have the same goals but not the same systems.
 - Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results. 
 - If you instead fall in love with **the process** rather than the product, you don’t have to wait to give yourself permission to be happy. 

### 4. Habits Shape Your Identity ###
- Change your outcomes - Losing weight, Starting college, etc..
- Change your process - New routine for the gym *not 3hrs everyday lol* , Eating habits..
- Change your identity - Be the person you want to be dont be defined by your past habits.
- Manifest youre new state of being by saying who you really are!

### 5. How To Change Your Identity ###
-  The more you repeat a behavior, the more you reinforce the identity associated with that behavior. 
-  This is a gradual evolution. We don’t change in one moment, but rather we change bit by bit, day by day, habit by habit
