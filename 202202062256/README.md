# The 7 Habits Of Highly Effective People Summary

## Part One - Paradigms and Principles

- Your **perception** shaps your **Paradigm ( Perspective of Reality )**
     - Realize that *every single person in the world* (Including you) has their own lens of Reality.
- “If we wanted to change the situation, we first had to change ourselves. And to change ourselves effectively, we first had to change our perceptions.”
- The **“character ethic” vs. the “personality ethic”**:
	 - **Character ethics**: integrity, humility, fidelity, temperance, courage, justice, patience, industry, simplicity, modesty and the Golden Rule.
		      - The integration of core principles and habits into one’s life.
		      - If you want to change the situation you are in , you have to change your identity (core principles and habits)
     - **Personality ethics**: positive mental attitude (PMA) and human and public relations techniques.	
		      - Quick-fix influence techniques, power strategies, communication skills and positive attitudes.
		      - Success is a function of personality, public image, habits, attitudes and behaviors, skills and techniques.
- “What we are communicates far more eloquently than anything we say or do.”	

- “**Paradigm** Shift”

	   - Term introduced by Thomas Kuhn in his book “The Structure of Scientific Revolutions.”	
	   - A paradigm shift is when an individual or society shifts its way of thinking from one framework to another.	
		       - Example: Shift from a geocentric view of the Solar System (e.g. planets revolve around Earth) to a heliocentric view of the Solar System (e.g. planets revolve around the sun) through the observation
-Shifts can be both positive and negative.

- **Principles** are deep, fundamental truths that have universal application.
	  - *Examples* of principles: fairness, integrity, honesty, human dignity, service, excellence, potential, growth.
	  - Albert Einstein: “The significant problems we face cannot be solved at the same level of thinking we were at when we created them.”

- **Habits**: The intersection of knowledge, skill and desire.
		- Knowledge is the theoretical paradigm.

- The “maturity continuum” represents stages of growth:

         1. Dependence paradigm: You Take Care Of Me; I Blame You For The Results.
         2. Independence paradigm: I can do it. I am responsible. I can choose.
		 3. Interdependence paradigm: We can do it. We can cooperate.
		 
## Part 2 - Private Victory

### Habit 1: Be Proactive		
 
- **Self-awareness**: The uniquely human ability to examine our paradigms and determine if they are principle-based or the function of conditioning and poor assumptions.
- 3 theories of determinism:

      1. Genetic: “your grandparents did it to you.”
	  2. Psychic: “your parents did it to you” (via your upbringing/childhood).
      3. Environmental: “something in your environment is responsible…”
	  
- “Highly proactive people…do not blame circumstances, conditions, or conditioning for their behavior. Their behavior is a product of their own conscious choice, based on values, rather than a product of their conditions, based on feeling.”

- *Reactive* people ("Go with the flow.") allow themselves to be at the mercy of their conditions and the environment.
- “I am what I am today because of the choices I made yesterday.”

- 3 central values in life:

		1. Experiential: What happens to us.
		2. Creative: What we bring into existence.
		3. Attitudinal: Our response to circumstances

#### Circle of Concern vs Circle of Influence
- The **circle of influence** is a subset of the **circle of concern**.
- **Proactive** people focus on their **“circle of influence”**: i.e. those things over which they have control and can do something about.
- **Reactive** people focus on their **“circle of concern”**: the wide range of issues and problems in which, in many instances, they have no control.

- We can choose our actions but we don’t get to choose the outcomes or consequences of those actions. We can, however, choose to accept our mistakes, learn from them and grow as a result.
- Making and keeping commitments with ourselves is a critical part of developing effective habits.(*PROACTIVE*)


### Habit 2: Begin With The End In Mind

- *Funeral Thought Experiment*
		- Imagine your funeral. Friends and Loved ones are in attendance. **What do they say about you? What are you remembered for and what do they remember about your as a person?**

- Examine your decisions through the lens of a *long-term perspective*.

- “Make certain that whatever you do on any particular day does not violate *the criteria* you have defined as **supremely important**, 
and that each day of your life contributes in a *meaningful* way to the vision you have of your life as a whole.”

- Create A “**personal mission statement**” as an effective tool for this habit:

		1. What you want to be (**character**).
		2. What you want to do (**contributions and achievements**).
		3. The values and principles you will use.
		
- Daily Affirmations are a way to remind yourself regularly of your personal mission and your goals. 

- **Everything you do should contribute to your identity or what you want your identity to become.*

### Habit 3: Put First Things First 

- Goethe: “**Things which matter most must never be at the mercy of things which matter least.**”
- Independent will makes effective self-management possible: “the ability to make decisions and choices and to act in accordance with them.”
- E.M. Gray: “The successful person has the habit of doing the things failures don’t like to do. They don’t like doing them either…but their disliking is subordinated to the strength of their purpose.”
			- Learn to enjoy boredom!
	
- Four generations of time management:

		1. Notes and checklists.
		2. Calendars and appointment books.
		3. Prioritization and goal setting.
		4. Manage yourself rather than manage time

- Effective people are not problem-minded; they’re opportunity-minded. They feed opportunities and starve problems. They think preventatively

-Computer metaphor for the first 3 habits:

			Habit 1: You’re the programmer. (Be proactive)
			Habit 2: Write the program. (Begin with the end in mind)
			Habit 3: Run the program.  (Put first things first)
			

## Part 3: Public Victory

- The “Emotional Bank Account”: Metaphor that describes the amount of trust that has been built up in a relationship.

- Ways to build the Emotional Bank Account (“deposits”):

		1. Understanding the individual. Understand what is important to the other person (and treat it as importantly as they do).
		2. Attending to the little things. Small courtesies and acts of kindness can loom large in the minds of those you help.
		3. Keeping commitments and holding to your promises.
		4. Clarifying expectations. Helps avoid misunderstandings and improves interpersonal communication.
		5. Showing personal integrity. Treat everyone by the same set of principles.
		6. Apologizing sincerely when you make a withdrawal
		
### Habit 4: Think Win-Win 

- 6 paradigms of human interaction:

	1. Win-Win: Seeks mutual benefit in human interactions. Life is cooperative, positive-sum game.
	2. Win-Lose: Competitive and adversarial. External comparisons with others. Winning comes at another’s expense (consider our approach to litigation).
	3. Lose-Win: “I lose, you win.” “Go ahead, have your way with me.” Permissive, indulgent. Win-Lose people use Lose-Win people. Lose-Win people bury their true feelings.
	4. Lose-Lose: The result of two stubborn, egotistical individuals. Each wants to “get back” or “get even” with the other.
	5. Win: This person only cares about what they get. What the other party gets is irrelevant. Let the other party do as they will.
	6. Win-Win or No Deal: “Higher expression of win-win.” If both parties can’t arrive at a win-win outcome, they agree to call off the deal or interaction. The “no deal” part of this framework gives you the option to go your separate ways rather than fall back to a less desirable outcome (like win-lose, lose-win, lose-lose, etc.).

- 5 Dimensions of Win-Win
1. Character: Integrity , Maturity , Abundance mentality.
2. Relationships: "Emotional Bank Account"
3. Agreements: Desired results for everyone can be positive and negative but still a win.
4. Supportive systems: Systems should be aligned
5. Processes: See the problem from the other point of view: articulate the needs and concerns of the other party as well as they can.

### Habit 5: Seek First To Understand, Then to Be Understood.

- The ability to **communicate** is critical to your effectiveness.

- Types of **communication**:

		- Reading
		- Writing
		- Speaking
		- Listening
		
- We spend the least amount of time training the skill of listening but use it so *regularly*.
- “Most people do not listen with the intent to understand; they listen with the intent to reply.”
- We filter everything through our **paradigm** and our perspectives. We read our personal autobiography into other people’s lives.
		- I.E. " I know how you feel." , "I went through the same thing."
	
- “When you listen with empathy to another person, you give that person psychological air. And after that vital need is met, you can then focus on influencing or problem solving.”
- Diagnose before you prescribe (listen and understand before attempting to influence). Really Hear what the person has to say.

- 3 keys to being understood (and making effective presentations):

		1. Ethos: Your personal credibility. Faith and trust people have in your competence.
		2. Pathos: Empathy, the ability to transcend our individual perceptions in order to deeply communicate and come to win-win solutions.
		3. Logos: The logic and reasoned part of the argument. Most people jump straight to this part of persuasion (skipping the first two essential pieces, ethos and pathos).

### Habit 6: Synergize

- **Synergy** combines all the prior habits to build something that is greater than the sum of its parts (“one plus one equals three”).
- Synergy is *unpredictable*: requires casting aside the old scripts and creating a new one

- Trust Levels of Communication
		- Low-trust: Defensiveness, protectiveness, legalistic language. Results in win-lose or lose-lose outcomes.
		- Medium-trust: Respectful interactions. Polite but not emphatic interactions. Does not maximize creative possibilities. Results in compromises with limited upside. Results in low-yield win-win outcomes.
		- High-trust: Logical and emotional interactions that value the differences between us and aim for high-impact win-win outcomes. (I.e Being upfront with critism with someone but use the "I" not "you")

- “Valuing the differences is the essence of synergy”: these can be mental, emotional and psychological differences. Thats what makes identity so special.

- To be **effective** you must recognize your own perceptual limitations and appreciate the **perspectives and experiences** of others.
- Adopt this mentality: “You see it differently. Help me see what you see.” 
			- " Walk in their shoes for a day."
- “When you see only two alternatives—yours and the ‘wrong’ one—you can look for a synergistic Third Alternative. 
There's almost always a Third Alternative, and if you work with a win-win philosophy and really seek to understand, 
you usually can find a solution that will be better for everyone concerned.”

### Habit 7: Renewal

- This habit is about maintaining and improving **yourself**.
		- Your greatest asset is you, so you must constantly attend to it.
		- Only You will allow you to be great!

- Four dimensions of renewal:

		1. **Physical**: Exercise, diet, sleep.
		2. **Spiritual**: Meditation, self-reflection, thought, literature and music.
		3. **Mental**: Learning, reading, writing, planning.
		4. **Social emotional**: Relationships, connection, service.	
		
These activities are all **Quadrant II activities**: high importance but low urgency. 

Strive to maintain *balance* in all of the above four dimensions;	**And your core principles and goals will follow.**
