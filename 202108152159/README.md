# ZettleKasten Founder & Method 

I was watching rwxrob's Beginner Boost Video on youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlecHo2p7aU&list=PLrK9UeDMcQLre1yPasCnuKvWvyXKzmKhW&index=3) 
He informed me about the  ZK method pioneered by Niklas Luhmann (https://luhmann.surge.sh).
Creating my own ZettleKasten to see what this thing is made of and starting my coding journey off right.
Keep Going and Push On you are your best teacher!
