# Chapter 3 - Commitment and Consistency


People need to behave **consistantly** to be considered strong, intelligent and reliable. Regardless of if their initial decisions were correct they will stick with that choice (*even if they know it is wrong*) to stay consistant.


*I.E Gamblers become more confident in their horses after placing a bet to appear consistent.*

**Social influence** is a big part of wanting to stay consistant for example:

When people make a **commitment** such as agreeing to watch someone's items, they are more likely to try to stop the thief then if you leave those same items there *unattended*.

If you can get someone to **commit** to a small initial action, it will be much easier to get them to commit to a larger action.

Personal consistency is highly valued in our culture, and automatic consistency offers us a shortcut through most of life. **Think of it as putting your brain into auto-pilot because this situation has had a positive outcome in the past.**

This "auto-pilot" saves us mental energy but leaves us vurnable to others exploits or weapons of influence.

Cialdini uses a Holistic lecture that was hastly debunked but still accepted by the people at the presentation because they **needed** this solution to work instead of looking for a better solution.

### 3 Tactics to Modify Ones Image

*Modifying one's self-image doesn't happen without the use of tactics.*

1. The first of these involves what Cialdini calls the "magic act" of writing things down. Cialdini explains that people are more likely to stick with things when they write them on paper than if they simply say them.
2. The second tactic involves making commitments public because people want to be seen as consistent. 
3. The third tactic is related to the amount of effort a person has to put forth once they make the commitment.


*What an individual may see as a single action actually has multiple layers that can be used for exploiters own gain.*
