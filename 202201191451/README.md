# The psychology of Money

 The Author examines personal finance through the lens of human behavior.
 Each of the first 18 chapters in the book explores an individual human behavior or attitude towards money.
 
 #### Here are some *Key Takeaways* for ya boy:
 
 Financial success is far more about how you behave than what you know.
 
 Luck and risk play a role in almost all outcomes. Individual effort can only get you so far.
 
 Be careful about looking at specific examples of outcomes the further you go back in history is the more you look more for general patterns, **surprises happen**.
 
 The hardest financial skill is getting the goalpost to stop moving. And to do that, you have to stop comparing yourself to others, and start determining what is "enough" for yourself.
 
 Staying wealthy requires some combination of paranoia and frugality.
 
Building wealth has little to do with your income or investment returns, and lots to do with your savings rate.
