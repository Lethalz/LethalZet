# Learning Markdown

Markdown is a simple markup language invented by writers who didn’t want to write HTML. 

Markdown has become the standard for most technical writing and is supported on Reddit, StackExchange, Discord, GitLab, GitHub, and pretty much everywhere else.

*  **Basic**	Emphasis on simplicity and compatibility
*  **Common**	General industry standard (but no tables)
*  **Pandoc**	Maximum power and flexibility, no HTML dep

Eventually you’ll want to use [Pandoc Markdown](https://github.com/Lethalz/LethalZet/tree/main/202108162145) for everything.
