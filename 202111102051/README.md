# Reciprocation: The Old Give and Take.. and Take.


The chapter opens with an anecdote about a professor who attempted a little experiment: he sent Christmas cards to a number of **complete strangers**, 
to see how many of the recipients would respond by sending him a card in return. 

It's implied that many people did exactly that, and the great majority never inquired into his identity:
They clearly received his card and automatically send one in return.

**Reciprocation** *is the "most potent of the weapons of influence."* According to the rule of reciprocation people feel compelled to give to someone who gives to them.

An Example of this is a homeless person standing outside of the bodega holding the door open for people asking for spare change.

Instead of just standing on the corner asking random people for money he is creating a situation where he is doing something for you so you can reciprocate with money.

Which i would imagine would yield more successful results than just "dry asking" people for money.

## Uninvited Debts

Reciprocation can cause us to feel indebted to strange, disliked, or unwelcome others - 
and it can also be triggered when someone does an uninvited favor.

While the obligation to repay is the value of reciprocity, the obligation to gracious in accepting gifts makes the rule easy to exploit: 
it reduces the risk that our gift will be refused, which helps ensure that it is accepted and the obligation along with it. 
To refuse a gift, or show ingratitude, is unacceptable to a socialized person.

Cialdini suggests that the reason small favors can command large ones in return is that the feeling of being indebted to another person is "highly disagreeable" - 
so when we consider the return of a favor we are motivated to escape this unpleasant emotional state, and are not calculating the value of the exchange.

## Reciprocal Concession

The process of negotiation an agreement or exchange, such as making a business deal, can be viewed as an exchange of ritual concessions: each party starts with a price, and then does the other party the favor of incrementing their offer closer to the other person's position in order to give the other incentive to return the favor by making an incremental adjustment closer to theirs.

You see examples of this in shows like pawn stars where they start at a price and make concessions in favor to the sellers needs depending on the value of the actual item being bartered. 

### How to say No 

 If you are prone to feeling regret for causing others social awkwardness, 
 
 recognize that people who use these tactics are not "normal" people in happenstance social interactions, 
 
 but manipulators who are intent on using your kindness against you - 
 
 and as such you should feel justified in handling them with just as little care and respect as they have for you.
