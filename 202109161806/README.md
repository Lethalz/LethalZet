# Retirement saving plans

### ***Traditional 401(k)***
* **Employer-sponsored** plan that gives employees a choice of investment options
* Initial investment is not added to annual income and is therefore non-taxable.
* You pay the taxes on contributions and earnings when the savings are withdrawn
* Employers will sometimes match the amount you put in to a certain amount
* If you think you will be in a lower tax bracket than when you retire take this out.

### ***Roth 401(k)***
* Initial investment is added to annual income and taxed according to current tax-bracket.
* You dont pay taxes on contributions and earnings when the savings are withdrawn
* Income earned on the account, from interest, dividends, or capital gains, is tax-free
* If you think you will be in a higher tax bracket than when you retire take this one.

**If you’re self-employed—e.g., a freelancer or an entrepreneur—
check out *SIMPLE IRAs*, *SEP-IRAs*, *and solo 401(k)s*. These plans
may permit you to put away far more for your retirement than you
could with just a traditional or Roth IRA.**

Don’t cash in your 401(k) when you lose your job or move to
another one. ***Roll it over instead.***
