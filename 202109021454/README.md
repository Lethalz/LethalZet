# Network Address Translation and Port forwarding

## NAT
To my understanding NAT (Network Address Translation) is used because we are exhausting all of our IPv4 Addresses (4.29 Billion to be exact).

So NAT takes your private IP address and private port and changes it to another IP and port Outside of the network so as to save IPs.


## Port Forwarding

Is like the Destination nat, in which you set an external IP/port number to map to a internal IP/port **Manually**
