# Think and Grow Rich Summary

### Key Ideas

1. **Desire, faith and autosuggestion.** 
- Success begins with a definite purpose, a Burning Desire also, an entrenched faith in that purpose’s validity, and affirmations that convince the subconscious mind of its inevitable success.
2. **Specialised knowledge and organised planning.**
- The most successful people embrace continuous learning of specialised skills and form a measurable, definitive plan supported by those they trust, including oneself.
3. **The power of the Master Mind.**
- Forming an alliance with a group of like-minded individuals that share the same definite end and offer particular skills to the cause drastically boosts our odds of success.
4. **Transmutation and the subconscious mind.**
- Our physical energy can be repurposed to bigger purposes, sending positive energy from our conscious to our subconscious mind. Our mind has more power than we think.


#### The 13 Steps Towards Riches:

1. **Desire** - A truly definite desire burns all bridges behind it and becomes an obsession until you make it a reality. "Win or Die."
2. **Faith** - Having Faith in oneself is one of the biggest proponents of success, it can be induced by daily affirmations. We are what we believe.
3. **Autosuggestion** - We can convince ourselves of our success - or failure - Through mental reinforcement.
4. **Specialised Knowledge** - General knowledge is of little use in the accumulation of money. To attract money, knowledge must be organised and wisely directed to a definite purpose. Why arent teachers millionaires "Knowledge isnt power, it's how you use it that gives you power"
5. **Imagination** - 1. **Synthetic imagination:** The faculty to arrange old concepts and ideas into new combinations. 2.**Creative imagination:** The faculty through which “hunches” and inspiration are received for fresh ideas. Hill suggests centring your focus on your synthetic imagination first, as you will use it much more often. "Dont wait for insipiration, Take action"
6. **Organized Planning** - Form a definite plan, measure your performance against it, and persist. If the first plan doesn’t work, replace it with a new one. Persist. As Hill puts it, “A quitter never wins, and a winner never quits.”
7. **Decision** - Take definite, firm decisions. Change your mind only if more detailed consideration suggests it is warranted. If Someone can change your mind you didnt have faith in yourself or your plan anyways.
8. **Persistence** - 1. **A definite purpose** backed by a burning desire.
           2. **A definite plan**, expressed in continuous action.
           3. **A mind closed** to negative and discouraging influences.
           4. **A friendly alliance** with encouraging people.
9. **Power of the Master Mind** - Power is “organised and intelligently directed knowledge.” KNOWLEDGE ITSELF IS NOT POWER. Form an alliance of organised knowledge with a shared purpose.
10. **Transmutation** - Those with historically great creative faculties were highly sexed. They knew how to turn sexual desire into an energy for creativity. Physical energy can be transmuted to a bigger purpose. I.E Gengis Khan
11. **The Subconscious Mind** - The development of “money consciousness” is in part achieved through filling your mind with positive emotions. We choose what we feed our subconscious minds, for better or worse.
12. **The Brain** - The right kind of mental stimulation can help to optimise creativity.Along with everything else we've learn the brain will adapt to your new think proceses
13. **The Sixth Sense** - The six basic fears are the fears of poverty, criticism, ill health, loss of love of someone, old age, and death. The key to overcoming these fears is recognising that fear is just a state of mind, and that one’s state of mind can be controlled and directed. You have absolute control and must exercise your willpower to overcome your fears.
