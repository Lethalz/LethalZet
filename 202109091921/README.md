# Basic Banking 

*Banking isn't as personal as it was at some time as a US citzen we have bounds of options regarding a place to keep our money.*

A good basis for looking for a Bank is making sure it has all the services you need (free checking , low fees, ATMs, etc..), And comparing it with other banks around you.

# Savings

Savings is important when looking for a bank because there are multiple ways to compound intrest on the funds in your account.

Some ways to save your money are:
1. Traditional accounts- Simple, effective, not as much long term yield as other options
2. Money market accounts (MMA) -  Saving account that pays higher intrest rates than traditional accounts but more risk in the short-run
3. Certificates of Deposits (CD's) - You make a initial deposit with a fixed interest rate. Yearly or Bi-Yearly
