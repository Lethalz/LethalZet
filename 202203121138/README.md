# Rich Dad Poor Dad Summary

**TDLR**

*Rich Dad Poor Dad* is about Robert Kiyosaki and his two dads—his real father (poor dad) and the father of his best friend (rich dad)—and the ways in which both men shaped his thoughts about money and investing.

Akin to The Richest Man in Babylon to build wealth has no wage requirement. ANYONE can be rich, being rich is in the eye of the beholder. being broke is temporary being poor is for life.

### 5 Key Book Ideas


1. The poor and the middle-class work for money. The rich have *money work for them*.
2. It’s not how much money you make that matters. It’s how much money you keep. (part of all you make is yours to keep)
3. Rich people acquire assets. The poor and middle class acquire liabilities that they think are assets. (i.e Houses , Cars)
4. Financial aptitude is what you do with money once you make it, how you keep people from taking it from you, how to keep it longer, and how you make money work hard for you. (keep the money flowing)
5. The single most powerful asset we all have is our mind. (knowledge is power)

### Quotes that stuck with me

*“To become financially secure, a person needs to mind their own business.”*

- When Kiyosaki says mind your own business, he means building and keeping your asset column strong. Once a dollar goes into it, never let it come out.

*"Work to learn, Not to make money"*

*"A new car loses nearly 25 percent of the price you pay for it the moment you drive it off the lot."*

*"Keep expenses low, reduce liabilities, and diligently build a base of solid **assets**."*


- According to Kiyosaki, **real assets** fall into the following categories:

1. Stocks
2. Bonds
3. Income-generating real estate
4. Notes (IOUs)
5. Royalties from intellectual property such as music, scripts, and patents
6. Anything else that has value, produces income or appreciates, and has a ready market

“A true luxury is a reward for investing in and developing a real asset.”
