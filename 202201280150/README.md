# Atomic Habits Part 3 & Conclusion 

### 3RD LAW - Make it Easy '

- “The best is the enemy of the good.” – Voltaire
- Sometimes people defer action on an issue because the options currently available are **not the best possible**. It is usually **better to act promptly** with a good option that wait until the best comes along.
- If you want to **master a habit**, the key is to start with **repetition, not perfection**.

- You don’t need to map out every feature of a new habit. You just need to **practice** it.
*Quality vs Quantity experience*

- **Motion vs Action**

1. If I search for a better diet plan and read a few books on the topic, that’s motion.

2. If I actually eat a healthy meal, that’s action.

Dont be a motion bitch be about that action Bro

- Having a plan will always help you start but planning too much can lead to procrastination 

- START YOUR HABIT TODAY! It doesnt have to be perfect but GET YOUR REPS IN.
- The *amount of time* you have been performing a habit is not as important as the number of times you have performed it.

- The *less friction* you face, the **easier** it is for your stronger self to emerge.
We try to write a book in a chaotic household.
We try to concentrate while using a smartphone filled with distractions.
- **2 minute rule**
-“When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do"

Instead of trying to engineer a perfect habit from the start, do the easy thing on a more consistent basis.
A new habit should not feel like a challenge.
- Success is less about making good habits easy and more about making bad habits hard. AUTOMATE YOUR HABITS.

### 4th LAW - Make it Satisfying

- Pleasure teaches your brain that a behavior is worth remembering and repeating.

What is immediately rewarded is repeated.
What is immediately punished is avoided.

- Consequences of bad habits are *delayed* while the rewards are immediate.
Brain prioritizes **NOW**

- The feeling of success is a signal that your habit paid off
    - Whenever they skipped going out to eat, they transferred $50 into the “Trip to Jamaican” account
    
- Select short-term rewards that reinforce your identity rather than ones that conflict with it.
Goal is saving; buying a jacket is not the reward

- **NEVER MISS TWICE** . Succesful people miss. BUT they dont turn that miss into a habitual miss. THEY ARE THE STEPH CURRYS OF THE WORLD
 
- The problem is **not** slipping up;
     - the problem is thinking that if you can’t do something perfectly, then you shouldn’t do it at all.

Lost days hurt you more than successful days help you. GET IT IN! Even on your worst days bitch.


### Conclusion ###

- Build habits that work for your personality.
    - lower on conscientiousness will be less likely to be orderly by nature
    - need to rely more heavily on environment design to stick with good habits.

1. What feels like fun to me, but work to others?
2. What makes me lose track of time?
3. Where do I get greater returns than the average person?
4. What comes naturally to me?

**When you can’t win by being better, you can win by being different.**

- The Goldilocks Rule
     - Not too hard. Not too easy. Just right
     - PEAK ENGAGEMENT
