# Financial Saving Goals


Save every month no matter what, everyone has menial things they can cut out of their life to meet a goal for saving that you set.

It's definitely going to be hard to start saving but you have to put your mind to it. 

This month im going to start using a App called mint to track my monthly expenses to see where all my money goes. 

At this point i know at least 50% is going to bud LOL but we're going to do this AND MAKE PROGRESS.

## Put a Price on your Goals

It may seem weird to do at first but its something you have to do to start getting realistic about your goals, If you want to go to hawaii next year you have to budget from the day you have that thought to the day you actually get to hawaii.

Putting it down helps you visualize what you need to do to make your goals a reality

### Financial Flexibily

You should spend no more than 30% of your monthly take-home pay on
housing, and dedicate at least 15% of your take-home pay to
savings. 

Don’t allow your monthly debt payments (not
including your mortgage) to exceed 20% of your monthly take-
home pay—or your total debt (not including your mortgage or
student loans) to exceed 20% of your annual take-home pay.
